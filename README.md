# reactzine

A single page app prototype using React.

# Install

## With Node.js

This method installs, builds the project and opens it automatically for you:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oncletom/reactzine.git
cd reactzine && npm install
```

## Git only

This method is suitable if you do not want to bother installing Node.js:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oncletom/reactzine.git
cd reactzine && git checkout gh-pages
```

Then double click/launch `index.html`.

## Without git

Least case scenario, you do not have either `git` or `node`:

1. [download the latest release](https://github.com/oncletom/reactzine/archive/gh-pages.zip);
1. uncompress it;
1. double click/launch `index.html`.

# Live demo

A live demo is available at [oncletom.github.io/reactzine](http://oncletom.github.io/reactzine).

A new version can be built and deployed by typing:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
